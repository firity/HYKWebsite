## Could-Haves

would be really cool ... if there's time:
- As a **user** I want to get an opinion where is the location of office so that I add map information.
  - [ ] Given live map context when trying to know where it is  then searching on map.
- As a **user** I want social media icons in the website so that I can follow hackyourfuture via social media and get some more information about it.
  - [ ] Given the user wants to find the icons easily, they should be prominent on the footer.
