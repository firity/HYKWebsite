# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- Deadline: 2 weeks
- UI design or color schemes: [**HackYourFuture**](https://hackyourfuture.be/)
- Technologies: **HTML , CSS**

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

- Team members level of coding experience is low.
- Team members are still learning to work together.

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Using developer tools** to check the original code of the website.
- **Skipping** some sections of the website that are unnecessary is okay. Skipping Java-script due to lack of knowledge.
- **One approval** is enough for pull request to speed up the workflow, because there are not always people available for reviewing.
- We will try to create the whole website but if there is not enough time, we will only make **Must-have pages**.
- Availability of the team members [see the time table](README.md)

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
-->
